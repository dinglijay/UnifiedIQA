This is the source code of the proposed unified IQA index.

There are two implementations of our model, one is MATLAB script and another is Python.

Please note that all the experimental results in this paper are based on our Python implementation. 

The MATLAB script is used to fairly compare running time with others. 

Moreover, the code will be publicly available online after the publication works.
